        content: (
          <p>
            Terramation, also known as natural organic reduction or human composting, is a gentle, natural process that transforms human remains into nutrient-rich soil. 
            It works with nature's principles to return the body to the earth in a way that creates new life. The process uses organic materials like wood chips, alfalfa, 
            and straw to create the perfect environment for natural decomposition, resulting in rich, living soil that can nourish plants and trees.

            <p>
              Terramation differs from traditional options in several key ways:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Compared to cremation:</strong> Cremation uses high temperatures (1400-1800Â°F) and fossil fuels to reduce the body to ash through incineration. 
              This process releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants into the atmosphere. Terramation, by contrast, uses no fossil fuels for the transformation process 
              and creates carbon-sequestering soil rather than ash.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Compared to burial:</strong> Traditional burial typically involves embalming chemicals, a casket, and a concrete vault, all of which prevent natural 
              decomposition and take up permanent land space. Terramation requires no chemicals, uses biodegradable materials, and creates usable soil rather than requiring 
              permanent land use.

            legislation. Laws vary by state, so it's important to check the current legal status in your area. We stay up-to-date on all legislation and can advise you

            Many religious traditions emphasize returning to the earth and the cycle of life. Terramation honors these principles by facilitating a natural return to the earth. 
            While specific religious perspectives vary, many people of various faiths have found terramation to be compatible with their spiritual beliefs, especially those 
            with environmental values. We recommend discussing with your spiritual advisor if you have specific religious concerns.

            The complete terramation process typically takes 60-90 days. This includes the initial transformation phase (30-45 days), where the body is gently converted to soil, 
            followed by a curing phase (30-45 days), where the soil stabilizes and matures. This timeline allows the natural processes to work at their own pace, ensuring the 
            final soil is rich, healthy, and ready for its next purpose. Throughout this time, we maintain communication with the designated family contacts about the process.

          <p>
            During terramation, the body is placed in a vessel with organic materials like wood chips, alfalfa, and straw. These materials create the perfect environment for 
            natural microbial activity. The vessel maintains optimal conditions for decomposition, including the right temperature, moisture, and aeration. Microorganisms naturally 
            present in our bodies and the environment do the work of transformation, breaking down organic matter into its elemental components. This is the same process that 
            happens in nature, just in a controlled, optimized environment.

            like wood chips, alfalfa, and straw, along with water and air to maintain the proper environment for microbial activity. This chemical-free approach is one of the

            to a fine powder which is incorporated back into the soil. The final result is a homogenous soil mixture where no discernible bone fragments or viable DNA remain. 
            This complete transformation is an important aspect of the terramation process, resulting in soil that is ready to nourish new life.

            Terramation is carbon negative for several reasons. First, the process itself uses minimal energy and produces no emissions, unlike cremation which releases COâ. 
            Second, and more significantly, the resulting soil actively sequesters carbon when used to grow plants. Plants capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through 
            photosynthesis, storing it in their tissues and in the soil. When the nutrient-rich soil from terramation is used to grow trees, gardens, or other plants, it
